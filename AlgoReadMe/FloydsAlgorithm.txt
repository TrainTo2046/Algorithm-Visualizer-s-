Floyds Algorithm

Cycle Detection

Two Parts

Part 1: Find the point of collision
slow pointers: moves 1 position
fast pointers: moves 2 position

move pointers until slow == fast

Part 2: Find the start of cycle
slow2 pointer: 
-   moves 1 position from head
slow pointer: 
-   moves 1 position

move pointers until slow == slow2

the point where slow and slow2 
meet is the start of the cycle in the 
over all list
