## Usage
Once the project is running, you can use the following controls to interact with the visualizer:
- **Choose an algorithm**: Select the algorithm you want to visualize on the left side of the window.
- **ReadMe**: Read about the algorithm with example on the left side of the window.
- **Code**: Select the Code Button on the right to eead the algorithm pseudocode.
- **Start**: Begin the visualizer by clicking on the Play Button.
- **Restart**: Restart the visualizer re-clicking the Play Button.
- **Reset**: Select the Algo-Visualizer Button to go back reset the program.
